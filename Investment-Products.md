## Fixed-Income Security
### I. Bonds
- Types of Bonds:
  - Government
  - **Corporate**: are issued by companies. Companies issue bonds - rather than seek bank loans for debt financing in many cases - because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.
  - **Municipal**: are issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors.
  - Mortage
- Definitions:
  - **Face Value/Par**:
  - **Coupon**:
- Credit Ratings:
  - Bonds are rated by popular agencies like Standard and Poor's, and Moody's;
- **How Interest Rates Affect Bond Prices?**
  - For example, if a current bond is issued with a coupon rate of 4%, the value of the bond automatically decreases if interest rates rise and a new bond with identical terms is issued with a 6% coupon. This reduction in market value occurs to compensate investors for purchasing a bond with lower interest payments than newly issued bonds. Conversely, if interest rates decline and new bonds were issued with 2% rates, the market value of the original bond increases.
  - Typically, longer-term bonds carry higher coupon rates than short-term bonds because the default and interest rate risk inherent in all bond investments increases with time. This simply means the longer you hold a bond, the more risk there is of interest rate changes rendering your bond less valuable or the issuing entity defaulting on its obligations, leaving the bond unpaid.
  - (**???!!!**) However, if you invest in highly rated municipal bonds and do not need to access your investment funds for several years, long-term bonds can be a very lucrative investment when purchased at the right time.
